abstract = {This study will test the usability of wearable, vibrotactile cues in providing intuitive orientation and communication cues to participants in visually challenging underwater navigation tasks. The device’s signals were designed to communicate the three levels of situational awareness (SA; perceive, comprehend, and project) intuitively, as if one was being guided by a partner’s hand. We evaluated the effectiveness of this device in a human subject experiment with divers wearing fully blacked-out dive masks. Performance with the vibrotactile display was compared against the Scubapro heads-up display, along with dive rescue team rope pulls based on performance measures (navigation, accuracy, and time). Subjective measures of mental workload, situational awareness, and usability were collected; as well as surveys designed to understand how participants classified tactor signals into SA levels. The results showed that the tactile design enhanced accuracy, but increased navigation time. This design was comparable to other standard methods across subjective mental workload, SA, and usability measures. The paper discusses the significance of these results for the navigation of both commercial and professional divers. It also explores the implications for navigation support in other visually challenging environments.}
