We are developing and validating a noninvasive optical sensor to continuously monitor **blood lactate levels** in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. This work is supported by a **Coulter Translational Research Partnership grant** and conducted in collaboration with UVA Anesthesiology and the UVA Health ICU team.

### Funding
- **Wallace H. Coulter Foundation** Translational Research Partnership (2025–2026)

### Study Overview
- Prospective observational study of **50 adult cardiac surgery patients**
- Lumos sensor applied during surgery and postoperative ICU stay
- Blood lactate measured every 4 hours via standard care
- Lumos spectral readings compared to clinical lactate values
- Goal: Validate real-time trend tracking and cross-skin-tone performance

### Collaborators
- Dr. Bob Thiele (Anesthesiology, UVA)
- Dr. Amir Malek (Data Science, UVA Health)
- Lucas Fernandez (Clinical Coordinator)
- Amanda Watson (PI, ECE)

### Goals
- Enable early detection of sepsis risk and poor perfusion
- Provide a noninvasive, continuous alternative to intermittent lactate blood draws
- Build toward a real-time sepsis alert system using biosensor trends

### Outcomes
- IRB-HSR #XXXX approved at UVA
- Preliminary spectral-lactate correlation models under development
- Pilot data collection in progress
